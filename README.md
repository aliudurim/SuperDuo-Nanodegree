# SuperDuo-Nanodegree

Udacity Android Nanodegree: Project 3

#Project description:

You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

#Why this Project?

Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

#What Will I Learn?

In this project, you will:

<ul>
<li>Diagnose existing issues with an app.</br></li>
<li>Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.</br></li>
<li>Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.</br></li>
<li>Handle error cases in Android.</br></li>
<li>Add a widget to your app experience.</br></li>
<li>Leverage the functionality of a library in your app</br></li>
</ul>

#How Will I Complete this Project?

##Improve two apps for this project:
<ul>
<li><b>Alexandria:</b> A book list and barcode scanner app.</br></li>
<li><b>Football Scores :</b> An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).</br></li>
</ul>

All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

#Rubric
##Required Tasks

<ul>
<li>Download a zip file of each of the two apps from the Downloadables section.</br></li>
<li>Read the UX Review in the next node.</br></li>
<li>Spend time exploring the current state of the apps, looking for ways they could be improved. Each app will need 2 or 3 improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review.</br></li>
<li>Execute the improvements!</br></li>
<li>For Nanodegree students: Make a single GitHub repo with your code for both apps, and submit through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.</br></li>
</ul>
